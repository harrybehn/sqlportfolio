## Steps followed 

### Step 1 : 
- **Load data into Power BI Desktop**.
- I use excel files in this project but in my actual work I would extract data from sql server and I would usually use native query for optimization.
- I used three datasets for this project namely, PlayerGamingSession1, Player, Nationality and PlayerGamingSession2. 
- PlayerGamingSession1 contains the columns PlayerID, Win(Actual Win), TheoWin, GamingArea, GameType and Dateplayed.
- PlayerGamingSession2 contains the columns PlayerID, Win(Actual Win), TheoWin, GamingArea, GameType, Month and Year.
- Player contains columns PlayerID and NationalityCode. Nationality contains columns NationalityCode and description.

### Step 2 :
- **Merge Queries**.
-  Next step is to merge Nationality table to Player table using the nationalitycode column to get the nationality description.
- Then merge Player table to PlayerGamingSession1 and PlayerGamingSession2. Close and Apply.

### Step 3 : Weekly Monitoring
### Step 3.1
- **Create Calculated Columns**.
- Create NationalityGroup column to group the nationaties into Philippines, USA and others.

- Create DateRange column to compare weekly performance. I used a fixed date in this project but in my work I use a dynamic date using this dax formula: Yesterday = today() - 1, P1W = today() - 8, ..etc.

### Step 3.2 :
- **Create Measures**.
- Create measures for total Unique Players, total TheoWin, total Actual Win and total Coin In.

### Step 3.3 :
- **Create Visualization for Weekly Gaming performance**.
- Use Matrix visual to visualize Unique Players by nationality and by DataRange.

### Step 3.4 :
- **Create Visualization for Weekly Percentage Change**.
- Create measures for Weekly Percentage Change for Unique Player Count
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/472d0991-26f8-4e96-aa76-16f2181474a2)
- Do the same for TheoWin, Actual Win and Coin In

### Step 3.5 :
- **Conditional Formatting for Weekly Percentage Change**.
- Create conditional formatting for Font Color.

- Add Icon using Conditional Formatting.

### Step 4 :Monthly and Yearly Performance
- **Create a Measure Slicer**
- I created a measure slicer so the viewer can see the **Unique Player** count, **Theowin**, **Actual Win** and **Coin In** yearly and monthly performance in one page.
- First step is to create a table with **Unique Player**, **TheoWin**, **Actual Win** and **Coin In** as olumns
  
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54ce1546-17b6-4d05-9f12-1ae02d00ccfa)
- Next Is to create a measure that retrieves the selected value from the MeasureSelection[MeasureName] column.

- Then finally create a measure that will dynamically switches between columns

### Step 5 :
- **Create Bar Chart**
-  I created bar charts to compare the monthly performance and yearly performance using the year column, monthname column and the measure that i just created which is DisplayMeasure
- Monthly comparison

- Yearly Comparison

- By Nationality
